		<h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a lifelong learner and hobbyist who finds equal inspiration in the warmth of the sun and the thrill of invention.
		Outside, you’ll find me riding my mountain bike through forest trails, soaking in nature’s beauty.
		Indoors, I love tinkering with my 3D printer, bringing new ideas to life one layer at a time.
		I’m also passionate about coding, regularly diving into projects that challenge my problem-solving skills.
		This balance of outdoor adventures and hands-on creativity fuels my energy, curiosity, and drive to grow.

      <h2>Work</h2>
      <p>
        I am a materials engineer with a deep interest in exotic material phenomena and microfabrication processes.
        Over the years, I’ve applied my expertise in materials science to the semiconductor industry, integrating data engineering,
        machine learning, and AI to enhance production processes. I am driven by curiosity and a passion for solving complex problems,
        always seeking new ways to innovate. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy learning from others to improve
        my skills and knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my thesis, I studied the aging of cathode-anode materials in lithium-ion batteries used in the automotive industry.
        The research was part of a Business Finland commission focused on second-life use.

        <!-- Thesis Worker, Aalto University -->
        <li>
          <strong>Thesis Worker</strong> – Aalto University, Espoo, Finland (2021)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Investigated the degradation of lithium-ion battery materials, specifically focusing on NMC811 and graphite,
              within a second-life use project. This involved a range of material characterization techniques and extensive
              data analysis.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <!-- Process Operator, Okmetic -->
        <li>
          <strong>Process Operator</strong> – Okmetic, Vantaa, Finland (2012 – 2017)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Began my tech-focused career at Okmetic as a Process Operator in a cleanroom environment, specializing in the
              Double-Sided Polishing (DSP) process for semiconductor wafers. Responsible for operating and maintaining
              precision polishing equipment, carefully handling loading and unloading procedures to ensure optimal wafer
              quality.
            </li>
            <li>Performed daily maintenance, troubleshooting, and critical quality control checks.</li>
            <li>Actively monitored process data, made data-driven decisions, and documented results in Excel.</li>
            <li>Conducted visual inspections to ensure wafers met industry standards before shipment to clients.</li>
            <li>
              Later, I expanded my responsibilities to include operating the Okamoto XLSSP single-sided polishing machine,
              which was new to the factory. This role required significant development work to maintain functionality,
              perform daily maintenance, and minimize wafer losses. After a couple of years, I also learned to operate
              wafer-sorting machines, broadening my skill set.
