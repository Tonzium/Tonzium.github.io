\# Work



I am a materials engineer with a deep interest in exotic material phenomena and microfabrication processes.  

Over the years, Iâ€™ve applied my expertise in materials science to the semiconductor industry, integrating data engineering, machine learning, and AI to enhance production processes. I am driven by curiosity and a passion for solving complex problems, always seeking new ways to innovate. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy learning from others to improve my skills and knowledge.



In my thesis, I studied the aging of cathode-anode materials in lithium-ion batteries used in the automotive industry. The research was part of a Business Finland commission focused on second-life use.
