# Experience

## Sr. Process Engineer – Murata, Vantaa, Finland (2022 – Present)

### **Silicon-Glass Fusion Process Ownership** 

Leading product/process qualifications, optimization, cost reduction, and yield improvement projects (with Engineer Change Notices—including planning, validation, documentation, safe-launch, and reporting).

- Metrology tool controls (MSA, Gage R&R).
- Implementing process controls and continuous improvements to reduce variation.
- Leading or supporting root-cause investigations (FTA, 8D).
- Overseeing purchases (item replacement) and supplier quality projects.
- Contributing to financial assessments and ROI analyses.

### **My Unique Skills:**

- Spearheading digital transformation initiatives by delivering end-to-end data solutions—ranging from novel data-collection strategies and robust database infrastructures to fully automated analytics.

- Creating and maintaining Power BI and JMP dashboards for enhanced analysis.
- Mentoring engineers in machine learning and deep-learning initiatives.

### Thesis Worker – Aalto University, Espoo, Finland (2021)

- Investigated the degradation of lithium-ion battery materials, specifically focusing on NMC811 and graphite, within a second-life use project. This involved a range of material characterization techniques and extensive data analysis.

### Process Operator – Okmetic, Vantaa, Finland (2012 – 2017)

- Began my tech-focused career at Okmetic as a Process Operator in a cleanroom environment, specializing in the Double-Sided Polishing (DSP) process for semiconductor wafers. Responsible for operating and maintaining precision polishing equipment, carefully handling loading and unloading procedures to ensure optimal wafer quality.
- Performed daily maintenance, troubleshooting, and critical quality control checks.
- Actively monitored process data, made data-driven decisions, and documented results in Excel.
- Conducted visual inspections to ensure wafers met industry standards before shipment to clients.
- Later, I expanded my responsibilities to include operating the Okamoto XLSSP single-sided polishing machine, which was new to the factory. This role required significant development work to maintain functionality, perform daily maintenance, and minimize wafer losses. After a couple of years, I also learned to operate wafer-sorting machines, broadening my skill set.
