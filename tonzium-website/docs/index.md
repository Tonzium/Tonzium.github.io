# About Me

Hi there! I'm Toni â€” a curious learner and hobbyist from Finland. I find inspiration both in the warmth of the sun and in creating new things. 

When I'm outside, I enjoy riding my mountain bike through forest trails and being close to nature. When I'm indoors, I like to experiment with my 3D printer and bring small ideas to life. 

This mix of outdoor adventures and creative work keeps me motivated, curious, and always ready to explore something new.
