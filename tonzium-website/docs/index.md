# About Me

I’m a lifelong learner and hobbyist who finds equal inspiration in the warmth of the sun and the thrill of invention.  
Outside, you’ll find me riding my mountain bike through forest trails, soaking in nature’s beauty.  
Indoors, I love tinkering with my 3D printer, bringing new ideas to life one layer at a time.  
I’m also passionate about coding, regularly diving into projects that challenge my problem-solving skills.  
This balance of outdoor adventures and hands-on creativity fuels my energy, curiosity, and drive to grow.
